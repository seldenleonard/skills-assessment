# 5. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

color1 = "purple"
color2 = "yellow"
color3 = "orange"

p "#{color1.capitalize} is my favorite color, but I do enjoy the #{color2} and #{color3} sky at sunset."
