# 5. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 9 if the number is less than 10, prints 19 if the number is less than 20, prints 29 if the number is less than 30, and prints -1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).

number = 14

if number < 10
  p 9
elsif number < 20
  p 19
elsif number < 30
  p 29
else
  p -1
end
