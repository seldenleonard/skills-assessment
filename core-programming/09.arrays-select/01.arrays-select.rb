#  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 20.
  #  For example, [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3] becomes [2, 18, 12, 3].

numbers = [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3]
numbers_under_20 = []

p numbers_under_20 = numbers.select{ |number|
  number < 30
}

# ALTERNATE SOLUTION - USING OPPOSITE METHOD
numbers = [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3]
numbers_under_20 = []

p numbers_under_20 = numbers.reject{ |number|
  number >= 30
}
